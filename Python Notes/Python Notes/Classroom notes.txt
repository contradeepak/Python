Data Types


1- In Python there are total 14 data types.

Realworld
Number -> int
Text -> Strings
image
video -> Binary
audio


1- Integer
2- Float
3- Byte
4- Bytearrray
5- Boolean -> True or False
6- None
7- Complex
8- Range

Advanced data types:

9- List
10 - Tuple
11- Set
12- FrozenSet
13- String
14- Dictionary


These are the 14 data types in Python.


-> List will be created using [] brackets.
-> Tuple will be created using {} braces.



Mutable : Changeable
Immutable : NotChangeable



List, Set, Dictionary are mutable and all the other are immutable.

Operators : Is a symbol that performs operatorions.

Operands-

a = 10

b = 20   assigning values


+
_
/
// -> Flow division 5
%  -> 00
*
**


AND


OR

Anyone is true all is true


NOT

not of true is false, not of false is true


Comparison Operators

a>b
a<=b


Assignment Operators

What is the difference between is and equal to operator.

Is is very important operator.




Control flow statements/ Conditions

a=10
b=20

if a>10:
<---->print(a)
else:
print(b)



if we use elif then remaining all the execution skips.



Loops pe notes banana hai,



Transfer statements 


1- Pass
2- Continue
3- Break



Advanced data types:

1- List
2- Tuple
3- Set -> frozenset
4- dictionary
5-string


List -

1- Ordered collection of data, Homogeneous=Similar types(e.g. array) of data
Heterogeneous= Combination, different types of data.


2- Duplicates are allowed.

3- List is created using [].

4- Mutable data type.(We can perform addition, removal operation, modification operation)

5- List is created using [] and using commas and is stored internally using 


Note : If any value in the function is TRUE, then it will print TRUE. 
If all values are false then it will print false.


: String value is always equal to true if it is not empty.

If the string is empty the check value is false.

Any string has the value true.
